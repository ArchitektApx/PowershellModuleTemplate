{{ModuleDescription}}

## Installation

```powershell
Install-Module -Name {{ModuleName}} -Scope CurrentUser
```

## Usage

```powershell
Import-Module {{ModuleName}}

# Your first example goes here.
```

## Development

{{Requirements}}

```powershell
./tasks.ps1 install_dev_requirements   # once per host, per PowerShell edition
./tasks.ps1 build                      # Source/ -> Dist/
./tasks.ps1 test
./tasks.ps1 lint
./tasks.ps1 coverage
```

See [Tools/README.md](Tools/README.md) for the full tool reference.

```

`test` and `coverage` build first themselves. Behaviour tests run against `Source/` by default
(`./tasks.ps1 test -Target Dist` switches); the artifact tests in `Tests/Module.Tests.ps1`
always read the built module from `Dist/`, the same artifact a user installs.

Classes and enums: files must be `.ps1`, they load in alphabetical full-path order on both
trees (name base classes so they sort before derived ones), and `using module` between source
files does not work. Tests that name a class type literally belong in `Tests/Module.Tests.ps1`,
reached via `using module` on the built manifest.

## Releasing

### 1. Prepare the release on a branch

```powershell
./tasks.ps1 prepare_release 1.1.0
```

This gates on lint/build/test, promotes the `[Unreleased]` changelog section to the new
version, stamps the version into `README.md` and `build.psd1`, rebuilds, and verifies the
built manifest carries the new version.

Review the diff, commit the stamped files, push the branch, and open a PR against `{{DefaultBranch}}`.

### 2. Merge, then tag `{{DefaultBranch}}`

Tagging is what triggers the release, and the tag has to sit on the merged commit. Pull
`{{DefaultBranch}}` first, otherwise you tag whatever you had locally:

```bash
git checkout {{DefaultBranch}}
git pull origin {{DefaultBranch}}
git tag v1.1.0
git push origin v1.1.0
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The tag must match the `ModuleVersion` in the built manifest, and `v1.1.0` must point at a
> commit that is on `{{DefaultBranch}}`. The workflow checks both and fails the release otherwise.

Pushing the tag runs `release.yml`: it re-runs the full CI matrix, publishes to the PowerShell
Gallery, and creates a GitHub release whose body is the `1.1.0` section of `CHANGELOG.md`.

Watch it under the repository's **Actions** tab. If it fails before publishing, delete the tag,
fix the problem, and tag again:

```bash
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.1.0   # delete the remote tag
git tag -d v1.1.0                   # delete it locally
```

> [!CAUTION]
> Only do that for a tag that never published. A version that reached the PowerShell Gallery
> can never be reused or replaced, so a bad publish needs a new patch version instead.

Publishing needs a repository secret `PSGALLERY_API_KEY`.

> [!CAUTION]
> Before the first tag, work through [Docs/HARDENING.md](Docs/HARDENING.md). Publishing to the
> Gallery means push access to this branch is push access to everyone who installs
> {{ModuleName}}. That guide covers the branch and tag rulesets, Actions permissions, secret
> scanning, and commit signing. None of it is on by default.
