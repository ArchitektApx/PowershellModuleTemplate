<#
.SYNOPSIS
Remove the last of the template scaffolding from a prepared repository.

.DESCRIPTION
Once './tasks.ps1 prepare' has run and the repository is hardened, the setup machinery has
nothing left to do. This deletes it:

  - Tools/prepare.ps1
  - any scaffolding prepare would normally have removed already (res/, Tools/templates/,
    Tools/platforms/, Docs/CLASSES_AND_ENUMS.md), in case the repo was prepared by hand
  - the 'prepare' and 'cleanup' entries in tasks.ps1, and the -Platform parameter that only
    prepare used
  - the prepare/cleanup rows in Tools/README.md
  - itself

Run it once, from the repo root:

  ./tasks.ps1 cleanup

It refuses to run on a repository that has not been prepared, and reports that there is
nothing to do if it has already run.

What it deliberately KEEPS:

  - module.psd1, because install_dev_requirements.ps1 still reads ModuleRequiredModules from
    it and the release workflow still reads ModuleName
  - Docs/HARDENING.md, which documents the live settings of this repository rather than the
    template, and is linked from README.md
